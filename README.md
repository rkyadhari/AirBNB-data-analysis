# AirBNB-data-analysis
Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree Program - Project 1
**Installation and Libraries**
As part of Udacity's Data Scientist NanoDegree Program, we are provided with Seattle AirBNB's data for our analysis.
Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle
The dataset consists of three files namely 'listings.csv', 'review.csv', and 'calendar.csv'
The standard libraries installed for the project:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

**Project Motivation**

We attempt to answer the following questions with the intention to help future visitors to Seattle.
1. How are the listings distributed by various property types?
2. What is the average price of listings by neighborhood?
3.What are the most expensive months to travel to Seattle in terms of reservation prices?
4. What are the main factors that influence the price of the listings?

**Steps:**
In order to answer the above business questions, the high level steps are mentioned below

1.Analysis of 3 files namely Listings,Review, and Calendar

2.Clean up data files for NAN valus and apply appropriate imputing stragegies

3.Draw inferences via charts,graphs, and heat maps on the varous attributes and features available in the data files.

4.Use Ramdom Forest Regressior and Linear Regrssion models against training and test data and choose the best fit model

5.Derive the most important fetaures for predicting the price of the listings

**Acknowledgement**
I would like to acknowledge and thank AirBNB for making the dataset public to be used for our project and also Udacity to give students of DataScientist NanoDegree program an opportunity to work with this dataset.

**Results**
By answering the above questions, I hope to have certain data points handy for visitors to look into before thay make their next reservation and stay at one of Seattle's AriBNB locations.
