# AirBNB-data-analysis
Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree Program - Project 1

As part of Udacity's Data Scientist NanoDegree Program, we are provided with Seattle AirBNB's data for our analysis.
Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle
The dataset consists of three files namely 'listings.csv', 'review.csv', and 'calendar.csv'

We attempt toi answer the following questions with the intention to help future visitors to Seattle.
1. How are the listings distributed by various property types?
2. What is the average price of listings by neighborhood?
3.What are the most expensive months to travel to Seattle in terms of reservation prices?
4. What are the main factors that influence the price of the listings?


Steps:

1.Analysis of 3 files namely Listings,Review, and Calendar

2.Clean up data files for NAN valus and apply appropriate imputing stragegies

3.Draw inferences via charts,graphs, and heat maps on the varous attributes and features available in the data files.

4.Use Ramdom Forest Regressior and Linear Regrssion models against training and test data and choose the best fit model

5.Derive the most important fetaures for predicting the price of the listins

Consclusion:
By answering the above questions, I hope to have certain data points handy for visitors to look into before thay make their next reservation and stay at one of Seattle's AriBNB locations.
